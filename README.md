# Roadmap

- [x] Create the perfect dimension, with almost no land
- [x] Make every villager spawn with a name
- [x] Make the overworld this new dimension
- [x] Rename the files
- [x] Explain how to use generate_assign_random_name_func.py

# Further ideas

- [x] Allow multiple biomes (even tho they will all end up being oceans in the end)
- [ ] Modify nether (like idk, make it void but allow spawning, like in ATM skyblock)
- [ ] Modify end? Idk how possible it that
- [ ] Allow teleportation portal with a special craft and everything (maybe with an Heart of the Sea? That would be sooo cool)
- [ ] Make the player spawn not very far from an island (it is doable with the `spawn_target` parameter)


# How to use this datapack

1/ Create a new world, but don't click on Create yet

2/ Go in datapack, Open Datapack Folder, and paster the datapack in it

3/ It should appear on the left side; click on it, and now it is on the right side :) This means it is going to be used

4/ Done

5/ Create new world



# How to add or remove names

Requirements: having Python installed

1/ Open generate_assign_random_name_func.py

2/ Change the names in `name_list`. If you are adding new names, don't forget to place them in the corresponding gender categories. A name can be placed in multiple categories.

3/ Run `python generate_assign_random_name_func.py`

4/ Create a new world with the datapack
