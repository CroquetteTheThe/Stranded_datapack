# Roadmap

[ ] Create the perfect dimension, with almost no land
[ ] Make the overworld this new dimension
[ ] Rename the files

# Further ideas

[ ] Allow multiple biomes (even tho they will all end up being oceans in the end)
[ ] Modify nether (like idk, make it void but allow spawning, like in ATM skyblock)
[ ] Modify end? Idk how possible it that
[ ] Allow teleportation portal with a special craft and everything (maybe with an Heart of the Sea? That would be sooo cool)
[ ] Make the player spawn not very far from an island (it is doable with the `spawn_target` parameter)

2/ Go in datapack, Open Datapack Folder, and paster the datapack in it
3/ It should appear on the left side; click on it, and now it is on the right side :) This means it is going to be used
